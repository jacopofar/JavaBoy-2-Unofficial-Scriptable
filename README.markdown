Want to create an autonomous agent, maybe training it, and want a funny environment to test it ? Or just want to play Game Boy games automatizing boring parts? In both cases, this is for you!

This is a Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulator based on JavaBoy with scripting/automatization capabilities.

The goal of this program is to make easy to create a program or script to control some game actions, from automating simple sequences of commands to enhance game experience to totally automated game play through machine learning techniques or whatever you want.

Features
-------
* GB/GBC emulation from JavaBoy with usual features like zoom and frame skip
* Debugging features
* Screenshot (press F11)
* JavaScript automatisms
* Integration of automatisms and normal game play, for example:
* * The user can control the game while an automatism is working
* * Automatisms can intercept button events, even the ones of other automatisms
* * Many automatisms can be active at the same time
* Some basic ML techniques to make algorithm implementation as fun as possible

Still to add
----
* ML tools, mostly Bayes na√Øve classifiers and neural networks
* Easy way to store and retrieve data like SQLite
* Start automatisms from GUI
* Console and messages to let automations communicate with user
